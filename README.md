# Shooter
***A Text-Based ASCII Shooting Game***

### Controls:
Move up, down, left and right (in the 2D plane) using the arrow keys. Shoot using the spacebar.

### Game Modes:
#### Defense Game
Prevent the enemies from reaching the end, or you lose health. You cannot fire while moving, and the camera is fixed to one screen. Move over the boxes with the H to refill health.

#### Killfest Game
Scavenge the entire field to kill enemies and killer turtles. You have magazines of 50, with a reload time. Move over the boxes with the H to refill health.

## To Play: 
Open the folder "CompiledCode" in NetBeans or any Java IDE and run "test.java". Enter either "defense" or "killfest" to choose a game mode. After you die, your score will be displayed and you will have the option to play again or exit. 

The Defense Code and Killfest code folders are there to view the separate games.
